# Project Summary: Exploring Design Patterns in Java
### Background
This project is designed to explore and demonstrate the use of various design patterns in Java. Currently, we have implemented the Factory design pattern and are also looking to integrate other patterns, such as the Builder, to illustrate their practical application in developing modular and maintainable applications.
## Objectives
- Implementation of the Factory Design Pattern: Demonstrate the application of the Factory pattern to centralize object creation and improve code flexibility.
- Exploration of the Builder Design Pattern: Introduce the Builder pattern to facilitate the complex construction of objects, allowing for step-by-step configuration.
- Demonstration and Comparison: Provide practical demonstrations of each pattern to illustrate their usage and benefits.
- Modularity and Extensibility: Create an evolving architecture using design patterns to simplify code management and evolution.
## Technologies Used
- Language: Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- Version Control: Git
## Conclusion
This project aims to illustrate the application of the Factory and Builder design patterns in developing a Java application. By implementing these patterns, we seek to enhance code modularity, flexibility, and scalability. Practical demonstrations and comparisons of the different patterns will be provided to showcase their use in real-world scenarios.
